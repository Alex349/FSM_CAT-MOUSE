DESSIGN & IMPLEMENT a scene with/where (minimum) [up to 50%]

Several different characters exhibiting substantially different behaviours
Movement relies in steering behaviours
Each character's behaviour is dictated by a FSM
Extra marks if [up to 50%]

There's a flock/swarm in your scene (50 boids minimum) and/or
At least one of the FSMs is hierarchical (HFSM)
There are other elements that "give extra value" to your work
DELIVER

The compressed Unity project containing the scene and all the required scripts etc.
A report containing:
Brief description of the scene (what's in there and how the characters are expected to behave)
Full diagram(s) of all FSMs
Full specification of, at least, the most complex FSM (the one with more transitions)  
For each state: enter, exit an in-state actions
For each transition: triggering conditions and transition actions
A description of other elements, not specified above, that "give extra value" to your work.
